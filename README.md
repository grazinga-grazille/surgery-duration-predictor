# Surgery Duration Predictor 🏥

A machine learning application that predicts surgical procedure duration using a Random Forest model trained on historical OR cases from a Canadian hospital.

Built as part of research conducted in the Department of Management Sciences at the **University of Waterloo**.

**Key contribution**: Obtained ~ 3min reduction in average scheduling error, applied across ~7,000 annual procedures, translates to an estimated $350k in annual OR cost savings — before accounting for cascade effects on overtime, cancellations, and resource utilization.

| Step | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Input** | Procedure description (free text), OR room, specialty, patient type, surgical priority |
| **Text features** | TF-IDF bigrams → TruncatedSVD (150 components, ~91.6% variance) |
| **Categorical features** | One-hot encoded: patient type, room, specialty |
| **Model** | Random Forest Regressor (100 trees, max depth 15) |
| **Target** | log(actual duration in minutes) — exponentiated at prediction time |
